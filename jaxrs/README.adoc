= Problem Details Implementation for JAX-RS

This is a JAX-RS proof-of-concept implementation for the Problem Details API. Limitations:

a. it's not built into the container, you'll have to package it into your applications, which means they are not a thin war any more.

b. the exceptions on the client side have to be registered manually (e.g., `ProblemDetailJsonToExceptionBuilder.register(OutOfCreditException.class);`) and are then wrapped in a ResponseProcessingException.

== Architecture

The architecture decisions are documented in our link:doc/adr/toc.md[ADR]s.
